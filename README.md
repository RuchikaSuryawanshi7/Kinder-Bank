## Our aim behind building KinderBank:

The core cornerstone of financial literacy remains evergreen in modern times, but with a technological twist. Savings and financial management lessons are still important, but they require significantly more contact and regular touch than in the past.

Based on this traditional mindset and ofcourse with the power of technology, we came up with the idea of **‚ÄòKinderBank', a smartphone application for kids to manage their finances, set savings goals, and understand the foundations of how money works, all just at the touch of a finger**

## What is KinderBank?

**KinderBank** is a mobile application designed by keeping in mind the gen-Z and the transformations in the aspects of money management along with the traditional 
evergreen methodologies. We at KinderBank, aim to provide teenagers a real experience of how is it like to have a bank account with features like **Savings Account**, 
**KYC Authentication**, **Interests/Rewards**, **Online Banking** (similar to UPI) and much more. 

We provide rewards for students after managing their finances at a better expectations. Monthly challenges or activities will be organized for students to earn badges and virtual money that would be ultimately included in their money bag.
We believe that teenage is the time when an individual gets a taste of the reality of life and needs to prepare oneself for the journey ahead. 

*The major objective of the application is to help teenagers become financially literate and soon become financially independent*. 

She Hacks provides the ideal opportunity to make this aspiration a reality and take the first step toward the goal of educating 10 million financially literate teenagers.
