## Our aim behind building KinderBank:

The core cornerstone of financial literacy remains evergreen in modern times, but with a technological twist. Savings and financial management lessons are still important, but they require significantly more contact and regular touch than in the past.

Based on this traditional mindset and ofcourse with the power of technology, we came up with the idea of **‚ÄòKinderBank', a smartphone application for kids to manage their finances, set savings goals, and understand the foundations of how money works, all just at the touch of a finger**

## What is KinderBank?

**KinderBank** is a mobile application designed by keeping in mind the gen-Z and the transformations in the aspects of money management along with the traditional 
evergreen methodologies. We at KinderBank, aim to provide teenagers a real experience of how is it like to have a bank account with features like **Savings Account**, 
**KYC Authentication**, **Interests/Rewards**, **Online Banking** (similar to UPI) and much more. 

We provide rewards for students after managing their finances at a better expectations. Monthly challenges or activities will be organized for students to earn badges and virtual money that would be ultimately included in their money bag.
We believe that teenage is the time when an individual gets a taste of the reality of life and needs to prepare oneself for the journey ahead. 

*The major objective of the application is to help teenagers become financially literate and soon become financially independent*. 

She Hacks provides the ideal opportunity to make this aspiration a reality and take the first step toward the goal of educating 10 million financially literate teenagers.

## How we built it
- Front-end was designed using Express, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery and Bootstrap framework.
- Back-end was supported using Node.js
- We used the Youtube Data v3 API for fetching the women made tech tutorials.
- MongoDB database is used to store the registered users and their details as well as the groups and their comments for the mentor/mentee page.
- We used bcrypt.js to hash the passwords in our database to ensure security of out users against any kind of data breach
- We used passport.js to authenticate our users
- We used UserWay plugin to make our web app more accessible to users with visual impairment or other similar issues.
- We used Canva to create our app logo as well as all the designs used on our web page.
- We used Heroku to host our web app.

## Future Scope
We strongly believe in the potential of our product. We think that it stands out from other trendy banking apps thanks to a strong concern over user experience and a well-designed layout. We believe that with some more time and the help of developers we could shape our idea into a ready-to-use service that would benefit the banks as well as the customers.
