## Our aim behind building KinderBank:

The core cornerstone of financial literacy remains evergreen in modern times, but with a technological twist. Savings and financial management lessons are still important, but they require significantly more contact and regular touch than in the past.

Based on this traditional mindset and ofcourse with the power of technology, we came up with the idea of **‚ÄòKinderBank', a smartphone application for kids to manage their finances, set savings goals, and understand the foundations of how money works, all just at the touch of a finger**

## Problem Statement

Adults and grown-ups in India show a clear lack of financial planning. As a result, the remedy to this problem would be to raise public awareness and educate people about financial stability beginning at a young age. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of personal financial planning in India. It's not only about putting more money aside and cutting costs. Financial planning entails a lot more. Financial planning is a step-by-step process for achieving one's life objectives. A financial plan serves as a road map as you travel through life. It essentially aids you in maintaining control over your income, expenses, and investments so that you may manage your finances and reach your objectives. Our purpose is to teach children how to successfully handle money, set goals, and plan for the future.

## What is KinderBank?

**KinderBank** is a mobile application designed by keeping in mind the gen-Z and the transformations in the aspects of money management along with the traditional 
evergreen methodologies. We at KinderBank, aim to provide teenagers a real experience of how is it like to have a bank account with features like **Savings Account**, 
**KYC Authentication**, **Interests/Rewards**, **Online Banking** (similar to UPI) and much more. 

We provide rewards for students after managing their finances at a better expectations. Monthly challenges or activities will be organized for students to earn badges and virtual money that would be ultimately included in their money bag.
We believe that teenage is the time when an individual gets a taste of the reality of life and needs to prepare oneself for the journey ahead. 

*The major objective of the application is to help teenagers become financially literate and soon become financially independent*. 

She Hacks provides the ideal opportunity to make this aspiration a reality and take the first step toward the goal of educating 10 million financially literate teenagers.

## How we built it
- Front-end was designed using Kotlin language and Android Studio.
- Back-end was supported using Java.
- We used AdobeXD to create our app logo as well as all the designs and wireframes used in our application.
- We used Canva for further editing and creation of PPT.
- We used Filmora to create demo video link.

## Future Scope
We strongly believe in the potential of our product. We think that it stands out from other trendy banking apps thanks to a strong concern over user experience and a well-designed layout. We believe that with some more time and the help of developers we could shape our idea into a ready-to-use service that would benefit the banks as well as the customers.
